                <p>In today's fast-paced world, the ability to maintain focus is crucial for achieving optimal
                    efficiency. By directing our attention to the task at hand and minimizing distractions, we can
                    enhance productivity and accomplish more in less time. When we prioritize focus, we cultivate a
                    mindset that allows us to delve deeply into our work, leading to heightened creativity,
                    problem-solving, and overall effectiveness. Whether tackling professional responsibilities or
                    personal projects, honing the skill of focus empowers individuals to excel in their endeavors
                    and make the most of every moment.</p>

                <p class="small-hiding"> Ever wish you could remove highlighter marks from a book? Lemon juice fades
                    highlighter enough to
                    make it virtually undetectable. Cut a lemon in half and get some juice on a cotton swab. Run the
                    swab over the highlighted text and watch the color fade.
                    Lemon juice from a container also seems to do the trick. Though not quite as well on the pieces we
                    tested, and the older the mark, the more stubborn it is to remove.</p>

                    the ends. I fill the tube with puppy food, and he has to roll it around to get the food to fall out
                    of the holes. My puppy gets all the food he needs without the mess that comes from eating too fast.
                    Be sure the holes are large enough for the food to come out! </p>

                    polish. I use a different color for each key. The nail polish is extremely durable and you’ll be
                    surprised how much longer it lasts than spray paint.</p>
