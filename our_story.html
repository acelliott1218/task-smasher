                    <hr>
                    <p>Task smasher was started with on simple task in mind -- to use the time we've got doing things we
                        love, instead of the things that keep us busy. Let's be honest; nobody, or at least very few,
                        people
                        love doing chores -- but when one of you's in medical school, and another working full-time,
                        you've
                        only got a few hours to yourself throughout the day. So our question: why spend those hours with
                        busy-work?</p>
                </div>
                <div id="our-goal">
                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-check fa-flip-horizontal"></i> Our Goal!</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We know we're not going to solve every single issue, but we hope these four tasks we've outlined,
                        which ended up saving us the most time, will do the same for you. Maybe it won't give you hours,
                        but
                        even minutes saved can be minutes spent with family and friends, instead of searching for keys,
                        feeding the dog, and so on. We want to give you your life back, at least in this small way.</p>

                    <p>We might be new, but for what we lack in brand-recognition, we make up for in passion. Again,
                        medical school for one of us, and full-time work for another -- it's obvious time matters to us,
                        and building this website took a lot of it! So, if time is so sparse for us, why would we go to
                        all this trouble unless we knew it was worth it?</p>
