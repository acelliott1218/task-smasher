                    <p>In today's fast-paced world, the ability to maintain focus is crucial for
                        achieving optimal
                        efficiency. By directing our attention to the task at hand and
                        minimizing distractions, we can
                        enhance productivity and accomplish more in less time. When we
                        prioritize focus, we cultivate a
                        mindset that allows us to delve deeply into our work, leading to
                        heightened creativity,
                        problem-solving, and overall effectiveness. Whether tackling
                        professional responsibilities or
                        personal projects, honing the skill of focus empowers individuals to
                        excel in their endeavors
                        and make the most of every moment.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Task smasher was started with on simple task in mind -- to use the
                        time we've got doing things we
                        love, instead of the things that keep us busy. Let's be honest;
                        nobody, or at least very few,
                        people
                        love doing chores -- but when one of you's in medical school, and
                        another working full-time,
                        you've
                        only got a few hours to yourself throughout the day. So our
                        question: why spend those hours with
                        busy-work?</p>
                </div>
                <div id="our-goal">
                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-check fa-flip-horizontal"></i> Our Goal!</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We know we're not going to solve every single issue, but we hope
                        these four tasks we've outlined,
                        which ended up saving us the most time, will do the same for you.
                        Maybe it won't give you hours,
                        but
                        even minutes saved can be minutes spent with family and friends,
                        instead of searching for keys,
                        feeding the dog, and so on. We want to give you your life back, at
                        least in this small way.</p>

                    <p>We might be new, but for what we lack in brand-recognition, we make
                        up for in passion. Again,
                        medical school for one of us, and full-time work for another -- it's
                        obvious time matters to us,
                        and building this website took a lot of it! So, if time is so sparse
                        for us, why would we go to
                        all this trouble unless we knew it was worth it?</p>
